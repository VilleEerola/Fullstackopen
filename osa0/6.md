    participant server

    Note: Browser requests the server to add a new note with POST request. Request includes new note in JSON format. Because there is header called Content-type, the server knows that incoming data is in JSON format.

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    activate server
    server->>browser: Created new note
    deactivate server

    Note: Now the new note is created with only one request from browser. This is possible because of different type of JS-code.
